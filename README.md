## Educational Children's Programming Game

Inspired by space invaders, this fun game aims to teach children basic programming concepts. The game consists of several levels, each of increasing difficultly. Each level consists of a short lesson followed by short questions on the lesson's material while zombies race down the screen. A correct answer defeats some of the zombies, not enough correct answers leads to Game Over!
